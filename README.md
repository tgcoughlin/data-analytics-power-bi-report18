--MIlestone 10 (SQL)

I have defined several SQL queries to extract key insights from the data, such as:

1. How many staff are there in all of the UK stores?

2. Which month in 2022 has had the highest revenue?

3. Which German store type had the highest revenue for 2022?

4. Create a view where the rows are the store types and the columns are the total sales, percentage of total sales and the count of orders

5. Which product category generated the most profit for the "Wiltshire, UK" region in 2021?
